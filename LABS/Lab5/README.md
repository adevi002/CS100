# Lab 5
*In this lab you will be extending your Compositie & strategy Pattern lab with a decorator, which will be used to modify expressions. You will be in charge pf building three separate decorator classes, and testing each one at different levels of your system. You must create the following classes as decorators:
Ceiling(ceil)
Floor(floor)
Absolute Value(Abs)
To implement the functionality of each of these classes, youmay employ the cmath library. This makes the implementation of the functionality tivial, so it is important that you are fully testing all variations of decorator composition, since this is one of the mor important concepts when discussion decorator patterns.*
