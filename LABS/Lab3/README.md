# Lab 3
In this lab you will create your first Shell scripts, and especially some scripts to manage C++ files. Get each section checked off by your TA after you have completed every section. Several sections mention tutorials that you should read. If you find that any tutorial does not adequately explain the concept then I encourage you to look for additional tutorials.
In this part, you will create and run your first Shell script, printing in the standard output “Hello world!”.

1. Read the manual for the commands echo and chmod.

2. Create your first Shell script named “hello.sh” (remember to use vim). In the first line of the file, write “#!/bin/sh”, this commented line indicates that this file is a shell script. Then, type ‘echo “Hello world!” ’. Save your file.

3. Execute your script: ./hello.sh. What is the result?

4. Make your file executable (i.e., chmod 711 hello.sh). Execute hello.sh.
