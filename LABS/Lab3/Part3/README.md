1. Create a header text file entitled “<Firstname>_<SID>.txt”, where <Firstname> is your
first name and <SID> your Student ID. Its content is your first name, last name, email
address, and SID. Use rigorously the format provided in the example file.
2. Write a script named “createEmptyMainFile.sh” that automatically create a source file
(“main.cc”), in the working directory, that contains the content of
“<Firstname>_<SID>.txt” at the top, and its last two lines are:
int main(int argc, const char** argv)
{}
